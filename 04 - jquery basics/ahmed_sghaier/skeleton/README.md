# Assignment 04 - jQuery DOM Manipulations #


## Installation ##
From the skeleton folder, run:
```
bower install
```

This installs jQuery and zxcvbn. You can also install the two dependencies yourself like so:
```
bower install --save jquery zxcvbn
```

You wil then find jQuery here: 
`bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js`

## Task 01 ##
We provide a small skeleton for task 1, which mainly includes CSS.


Have fun!
